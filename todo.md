# TODO
Things that are missing, or I otherwise *want* to implement

## Missing
1. Reads from blog entry directory and displays on page
2. Better navigation than the [current](http://hjf.io/blog/blog.php) system 'used'
3. Use of handlebars to keep each blog looking the same

## What Will Also Be Implemented
1. Auth, so that a user may login and add blog entries
  - Adding to this, auth info will possibly saved in the config.json
  - Auth will be hashed and saved to the database
2. Editing of blog entries
